# Overview

**DynOK** stands for "**Dyn**amic **O**bject **K**otlin". It is a pure Kotlin library that allows to create objects with properties that are defined at runtime, similarly to javascript objects. 
It is possible to dynamically retrieve, add and modify the properties of a dynamic object. You can also serialize and deserialize dynamic objects from and to JSON.

The library adopts a functional programming style and relies on the [Arrow](https://arrow-kt.io) library.
